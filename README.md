## MEGADOT
![Screenshot of my shell prompt](megadot/bashstyle.png)

This is a personal project of various dot files.

Base of these files were forked from various git repos @:

[Dotfiles](dotfiles.github.io) > Massive props to [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

Further concatenation of ideas will occur in this ongoing project.

## Future ideas include:

Dark Mode Options File -> For Dark Mode Extention on most browsers.
Hosts File -> For specific site script blocking, mostly for bitcoin mining.


These files are under the MIT license.


## WINDOWS ADJUSTMENT
For use with Git Bash found ~ on line 117 in .bash_prompt:

```bash
PS1+="\n"; should be changed to PS1+=$'\n';
```
