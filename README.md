This is a personal project of various dot files.

Base of these files are from various git repos:

[Dotfiles](dotfiles.github.io)  

## Specific Thanks
[Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

Further concatenation of ideas will occur in this ongoing project.

## Future Ideas Include:

Dark Mode Options File -> For Dark Mode Extention on most browsers.
Hosts File -> For specific site script blocking, mostly for bitcoin mining.


These files are under the MIT license.


## Adjustment for Windows
For use with Git Bash found on line ~117 in .bash_prompt:

```bash
PS1+="\n"; should be changed to PS1+=$'\n';
```
